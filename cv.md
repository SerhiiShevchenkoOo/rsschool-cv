  **_About me_**
  After six years of studying computer-integrated technology, I realized that programming is not only a hobby for me, but also a favorite pastime. Every day I develop in this direction, reading specialized literature and forums, as well as watching informative videos.
  At this stage in my life, I really want to connect my future with programming.
